# Network

## Steps for Building and Cultivating Your Network

1. Identify those on whom you depend to get your job done.
   - Whose cooperation do I need?
   - Whose compliance do I need?
   - Whose opposition would keep me from accomplishing my work?
1. Draw a map of these dependencies.
   - Create a diagram showing how you relate to or depend upon others in the organization.
   - Be sure your "dependencies map" shows first-order as well as second-order dependencies.<TODO, do the real work and create one !>
   - For example, you may be dependent not only on your immediate supervisor but also on his or her boss.
   - Remember: ***It's better to overestimate rather than underestimate the number of dependencies important to your network. Some otherwise successful managers have been derailed because they were blindsided by someone whose position and power they hadn't anticipated.***
1. Figure out how each person in your "dependencies map" sees the world.
   - For each person in your map, answer these kinds of questions, if possible:
      - What differences exist between myself and this person (in terms of goals, values, stakes, pressures, and working styles)?
      - What are the underlying forces that have created those differences?
      - What sources of power do I have relative to this person?
      - What might this person's assumptions, perceptions, and feelings be about my decisions and actions?
1. Assess the quality of your relationship with each person in your dependencies map.
   - For each person on your map, answer these kinds of questions, if possible:
      - Do we share mutual trust and credibility?
      - Do we perceive one another as competent?
      - Do we perceive one another as wanting to do the right thing?
      - Do we perceive one another as being able to get the job done?
1. Identify critical gaps in your relationships.
   - Depending on your responses to the questions in Step 4, decide which relationships most need strengthening. These are connections with people who are critical to your success but with whom you do not yet have a high-quality relationship.
1. Work to enhance essential but weak relationships.
    - **Get to know people with whom you need a stronger relationship**, perhaps by having casual conversations in the hallway with them grabbing a bite to eat at lunch asking them for their advice on something learning more about their work by attending training programs geared specifically toward them
    - Remember: **The best time to begin building these relationships is before you really need them.** That way, these connections will be established when you need to make a request.
