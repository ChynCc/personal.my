1. Understand the differences: INFJs and INTJs have different dominant functions. INFJs lead with Introverted Intuition (Ni) and Extroverted Feeling (Fe), while INTJs lead with Introverted Intuition (Ni) and Extroverted Thinking (Te). Understanding how these functions manifest in your behavior can help you identify areas where you might want to make changes.

2. Develop your thinking skills: INTJs are known for their logical and analytical thinking. You can work on developing your critical thinking skills by engaging in activities that **challenge you intellectually**, such as problem-solving, puzzles, or **learning new subjects that require logical reasoning.**

3. Practice being more objective: INTJs tend to **prioritize objectivity in their decision-making processes**. You can work on being more objective by considering facts and evidence before making judgments or decisions. Try to detach yourself emotionally from situations and analyze them from a rational perspective.

4. Improve your planning and organization skills: INTJs are typically very organized and strategic in their approach to tasks and goals. You can work on improving your planning skills by setting clear goals, breaking them down into smaller tasks, and creating a timeline for achieving them.

5. Engage in introspection: Reflect on your own thought processes, behaviors, and motivations. Identify areas where you feel your INFJ tendencies may be holding you back from expressing your INTJ side, and try to consciously adjust your behavior in those situations.

6. Seek feedback: Ask for feedback from trusted friends, family members, or colleagues who are familiar with both personality types. They may be able to provide insights into areas where you can make adjustments to align more with the INTJ type.
