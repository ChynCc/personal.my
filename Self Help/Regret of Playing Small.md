Playing small is the fastest path to regret.  
  
Settling for less costs more than you realise.  
Here's how to reclaim what you deserve.  
  
8 Times You Played Smallâ€”And Paid the Price  
(And what to do next time):

â†³ You held back your voice and ideas.  
â†³ Next time, speak up and be heard.

â†³ You avoided conflict and let tension continue.  
â†³ Confront issues directly; look for resolution.  
  
3. **You settled for unclear feedback**  
â†³ You accepted vague feedback, instead of specific.  
â†³ Ask for clarity to help professional growth.  
  
4. **You continued in a role youâ€™d outgrown**  
â†³ You stayed where it felt comfortable.  
â†³ Look for challenges to avoid stagnation.  
  
5. **You took on work that wasnâ€™t yours**  
â†³ You overloaded yourself by doing others' work.  
â†³ Enforce boundaries to protect your time.  
  
6. **You over-compromised in negotiations**  
â†³ You settled for less than your worth.  
â†³ Negotiate boldly, and anchor to your value.  
  
7. **You didnâ€™t advocate for a promotion**  
â†³ You waited passively for recognition.  
â†³ Be bolder; advocate for what youâ€™ve earned.
