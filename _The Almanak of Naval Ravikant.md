**Book - The Almanac of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to wealth and happiness** #P1 

## Notes

## Principles, Goals and Vision

  - **Earn with your mind not your time.**
      - Value your time. Set yourself an hourly rate and only focus on things that is important enough.
    - Outsource those things that eat your time.
      - Always try to make more money to earn your "Freedom" not keep upgrading your life style if that's unsustainable.

- Your goals affect what you will build.
      - Ex. Quit your job and run another startup vs Have your job and still keep have single source of income

- Owning the product/biz equity in a biz
    - Without ownership, your inputs are very cloesly tie to your outputs
    - Without ownerhisp, when you are sleeping you are not earning
    - You should own a product/biz/IP
      - You are never to get rich renting out your time.
        - You don't get rich by spending your time to saving money but saving your time to make more money.
    - **Ownership make you rich. Without ownership your input is closely tied to your outputs. You are just in salaried job.**
    - Without ownership, when you are sleeping you are not earning. You owned the upside. When you owned debt, you own guaranteed revenue streams and you also owned the downside.

- When you do things for their own sake, you create your best work.
      - Follow your intellectual curiosity more than whatever is "hot" right now. If your curiosity ever leads you to a place where society eventually wants to go, you'll get paid extremely well.
      - Make yourself feels like playing all the time. Choose whatever you like.
      - Your character and reputation are things you can build.
    - Your passion is not your edge. Your edge (specific knowledge) is a combination skills of you that outperform everyone. Including those expert are only good in 1 or 2 areas. Find your edge.
      - Ex. Sales Skill is one of them. Or very good in instrument etc
      - Ex. I am good in technical stuff and apply it in working environment to resolve problem.
  
- To get out of competition trap.
    - Find the thing you know how to do it better than anyone else so that no one can compete with you.
  
## How to get "lucky"

- Be sensitive to chances others miss.
  - Hustle until you stumble into it. (Keey trying)
  - Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportutnity will seek you out. (This is me)
  - Even you do all the best things you could. Be patient.
- You are more likely to have skills society does not yet know how to train other people to do.
  - You get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and doesn't know how to get elsewhere.

## Money 

- Money is an IOU when you create something that they want and they thank you.
- Society always want new things. You can provide that when the society doesn't know how to build it yet, scale it out to get wealthy.
- The most important skills of getting rich is becoming good in learning anything that you want to learn.
- To become an expert in a brand-new field in 9 ~ 12 months and study the right thing and not 4 years degree anymore.
- Foundation knowledge is far more important than expert knowledge. Ex. Persuasive speaking, break things down into simple english.
- **Compounding things is important**. Ex. Compounding wealth, knowledge, business relationship, reputation.
- Find the right thing to do. Then right people. Invest deeply, stick with it decades compound them.
- Clear Accountability is important. Without clear accountability you don't have incentives. Without accountability you can't build credibility.

## How to get rich (without getting lucky)

- Seek **Wealth**, not money or status.
- Wealth is having assets that **earn while you sleep**.
- Money is how we **transfer time and wealth**.
- Status is your place in the **social hierarchy**.

- You're not going to get rich renting out your time. You must **own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.**

- You will get rich by **giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get**. At scale.

### **Industry**

- Pick an **industry where you can play long-term games** with long-term people.
- The **internet** has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet. (As well as AI)

### **People**

- **Ignore people playing status games**. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.
- Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy and above all, **integrity**.
- **Don't partner with cynics and pessimist**. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.

## Knowledge

- **Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.** #solo/wisdom 
- Arm yourself with **specific knowledge**, **accountability** and **leverage**.
- Specific knowledge is **knowledge you cannot be trained for**. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.
- Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your **genuine curiosity and passion** rather than whatever is hot right now.
- **Building specific knowledge will feel like play** to you but will look like work to others.
- **When specific knowledge is taught, it's through apprenticeships, not schools**
- Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.
- Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. **It cannot be outsourced or automated.**

## Accountability

- **Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name**. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity and leverage.

## Leverage

- "Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth." - Archimedes
- **Fortunes require leverage**. Business leverage comes from **capital, people and products** with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
- Capital means money. To raise money, **apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgement**.
- Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.

## Labor

- **Labor** means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but **don't waste your life chasing it**.
- **Capital and labor are permissioned leverage**. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
- **Code and media are permission less leverage**. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
- **An army of robots is freely available** - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.
- If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.
- **Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement**.

## Judgement / Decision

- **Judgement requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills**.
- There is no skill called "Business". **Avoid business magazines and business classes**.
- **Study microeconomics, game theory, psycvhology, persuation, ethics, mathematics and computers.**
- "When you are in pain" - is a moment of truth. Suffering is the moment we cannot deny reality.

## Doing

- **Reading** is faster than **listening**. **Doing is faster than watching**. #solo/wisdom 

## Time

- You should **be too busy to "do coffee"** while still **keeping an uncluttered calendar.**
- Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. **If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.**
- **Work as hard as you can**. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.
- **Become the best in the world at what you do**. Keep **redefining** what you do until this is true.
- **There are no get-rich-quick schemes**. Those are just someone else getting rich off you.
- When you're finally wealthy, you will realize it wan't what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another.
- **You don't get rich by spending your time to save money.** #solo/wisdom 
- **You get rich by saving your time to make money.** #solo/wisdom 

## Productize yourself

- No one can compete with you on being you.
- Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most.

## Judgement

- **In an age of leverage, one correct decision can win everything.**  #solo/wisdom 
    - The direction you're heading in matters more than how fast you move, especially with leverage. 
- Without hard work, you'll develop neither judgment nor leverage. 


## Happiness 

- Happiness is a very evolving thing. 
- **Happiness is the state when nothing is missing - you mind shuts down and stops running into the past of future to regret something or to plan something.**  #quote 
- Tao Te Ching - If I say I am happy, that means I was sad at some point. Every positive thought even has seed of a negative thought within it or vice versa. 
- Happiness ... is mainly...
    - Not Suffering
    - Not Desiring
    - Not Thinking too much about the future 
    - ... or past. 
    - Embracing the Present Moment
    - and the Reality of what is and the way it is
- If you ever want to have peace in your life, you have to move beyond good and evil.


## Saving Yourself 
- No one in the world is going to beat you at being you.
